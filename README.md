# Retro Snake Game

This project is a simple Retro Snake Game inspired by the iconic Nokia Snake game, built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, JavaScript is used to:

- Draw the game board
- Create and control the snake
- Randomly generate food on the board
- Make the snake move
- Increase the snake’s size when it eats food
- Increase the snake’s speed as the game progresses
- Track the player's score
- Detect collisions for the snake
- Display the current score and the high score
